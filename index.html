      <p>Chris Nguyen here. Avid adventurer, brave eater and courageous dog lover. Professionally, I do IT/Support for a software consulting company. We primarily work with Microsoft, delivering custom solutions or updating older assets as needed. I have been with my current employer for nearly 5 years. Over that time I have worn many hats, from a lowly first tier support to being attached to projects as the primary IT consultant under the direction of the project architect. I don't mind IT, but development has always piqued my interest.</p>

      <p>I decided to enroll in UCI's continuing education web development bootcamp to see if I have what it takes to become a developer. We learned how to make this portfolio in the first week and I can't wait to see what we'll learn over the next few months. When I'm not working or in school, I do things like rock climb, eat and read about the ever changing world of web development.</p>
