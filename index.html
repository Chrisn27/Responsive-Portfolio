				<p>
				Chris Nguyen here.  Avid adventurer, brave eater and courageous dog lover.  Professionally, I do IT/Support for a software consulting company.  We primarily work with Microsoft, delivering custom solutions or updating older assets as needed.  I have been with my current employer for nearly 5 years.  Over that time I have worn many hats, from a lowly first tier support to being attached to projects as the primary IT consultant under the direction of the project architect.  I don't mind IT, but development has always piqued my interest. 
				</p>

				<p>
				I decided to enroll in UCI's continuing education web development bootcamp to see if I have what it takes to become a developer.  We learned how to make this portfolio in the first week and I can't wait to see what we'll learn over the next few months.  When I'm not working or in school, I do things like rock climb, eat and read about the ever changing world of web development.
